    Implements a ``threading`` API for Austin so that it can be used alongside
    other threads.

    The following example shows how to make a simple threaded echo
    implementation of Austin that behaves exactly just like Austin.

    Example::

        class EchoThreadedAustin(ThreadedAustin):
            def on_ready(self, process, child_process, command_line):
                print(f"Austin PID: {process.pid}")
                print(f"Python PID: {child_process.pid}")
                print(f"Command Line: {command_line}")

            def on_sample_received(self, line):
                print(line)

            def on_terminate(self, data):
                print(data)
